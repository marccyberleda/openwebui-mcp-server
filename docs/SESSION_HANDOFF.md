## Last Updated
Not yet — no session has ended with this file in place.

## Instructions for Claude Code
At session end, OVERWRITE this file (not append) with:
- **What Was Done**: 3-5 bullet points of completed work
- **Current State**: package version, what tools work, any known issues
- **Open Items**: next features, bug fixes, release tasks
- **Decisions Made**: API design decisions made this session
- **Key Files Changed**: file paths that were modified

Keep under 100 lines. This is a relay baton, not a history log.
